# House-price-prediction
# Why i built it?
- Purpose: You've built a simple linear regression model to predict housing Price based on Area.
- Demonstration: It shows how linear regression can model the relationship between a predictor (Area) and a target (Price) for housing data.
- Evaluation: Helps understand model performance via metrics like RMSE and R².

# How i built it?
1. Dataset Used: A small sample dataset with Area and Price of houses.
2. Modeling Steps:
    - Selected Area as the predictor (X) and Price as the target (y).
    - Split data into training and testing sets (train_test_split).
    - Fit a LinearRegression model from sklearn.
    - Made predictions on test data.
3. Evaluation Metrics:
    - RMSE: Indicates prediction error magnitude.
    - R² Score: Shows how well Area explains Price variance.
4. Visualizations:
    - Price vs Area: Scatter plot with regression line shows relationship.
    - Actual vs Predicted: Compares predictions to actual prices.

# What i built?
- Implemented a basic simple linear regression.
- Evaluated model with RMSE and R².
- Visualized data fit and prediction accuracy.
